     * A class to implement the optimization algorithm used to generate
     * playlists from a set of biases. The method used here is slightly
     * complicated. It uses a a combination of heuristics, genetic algorithms,
     * and simulated annealing. The steps involved are documented in the source
     * code of BiasSolver::run.

       The whole operation is a little bit tricky since the bias solver runs as
       separate job without it's own event queue.

       The signals and slots are all handled via the UI threads event queue.
       Since the BiasSolver and all biases are created from the UI thread this
       is also the event queue of all objects.
       Bottom line: don't create objects in the bias solver that use signals.


     * Playlist generation is now done by adding tracks until we run out of time
     * or out of candidates.
     * We are back stepping a couple of times in such a case.
     *
     * The old bias solver that tried different optimization solutions is
     * not longer used. If you want to see the old code and/or re-use parts
     * of it see Amarok 2.7
     *
     * To use the solver:
     * Create an instance
     * enqueue the job. When the job is finished, call solution to get the
     * playlist produced.
