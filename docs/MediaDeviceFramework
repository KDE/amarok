Media Device Framework
==

1. Solid Interface

Solid is KDE's hardware detection library, and Amarok uses it to detect
all of the devices that it knows how to interface with.  It does this
through two classes:

MediaDeviceCache(singleton) - Talks directly to Solid, gets list of all
present media devices and external hard drives, even if Amarok does not
support them.

MediaDeviceMonitor(singleton) - Talks to the MDC to see what devices are
available.  Keeps track of the kind of devices that Amarok supports. 
It does this by receiving and caching a single ConnectionAssistant
object from the MediaDeviceCollectionFactory of the particular device
type, so that as devices are detected, they can be tested for
compatibility with Amarok.

2. Collection/Metadata

Music-related data in Amarok is handled in Collections, themselves
consisting of metadata such as Tracks, Artists etc.  The base classes
to set up collections are abstract, and several classes which provide
more media-device-specific methods are available to be subclassed.  It
is some of these classes that must be subclassed to add support in
Amarok for a device.  The heart of it all is MediaDeviceHandler, and
this class will be discussed in depth.

NNTS = No Need To Subclass

2.1 Connection

ConnectionAssistant - Knows how to identify that a particular device
matches the type of this CA.  Can also create MediaDeviceInfo.

MediaDeviceInfo - Contains the device-specific information pertinent to
connection, such as mountpoint.

2.2 Factory/Collection

MediaDeviceCollectionFactory(NNTS) - Creates
MediaDeviceCollections. Provides ConnectionAssistant to register the
appropriate device type with the MDM.

MediaDeviceCollection - Given a MediaDeviceInfo object, connects to the
device described by creating a MediaDeviceHandler.  Provides a few
other rudimentary functions.

MediaDeviceCollectionLocation(NNTS) - Receives/sends orders to add
tracks to Collection, remove them, copy them. move them.  Forwards the
low-level work (the actual copying/deleting etc.) to the
MediaDeviceHandler.

MediaDeviceMeta*(NNTS) - The actual metadata a Collection consists of:
Track, Album, Artist, Genre, Composer.  No need to reimplement these,
as they are standard across all devices, and the interactions
concerning them are dealt with in the MediaDeviceHandler.

2.3 Handler and Capabilities

2.3.1 Handler

MediaDeviceHandler - This is it.  This is the beast that knows how to
do all the low-level tasks specific to a given device: connection,
parsing metadata, copying, deletion, changing of metadata, battery%,
device capacity, the whole lot of it.  Since it is responsible for so
many pieces, and since these pieces vary greatly from device to device,
it actually relies on Capability-based classes that each know how to do
a particular job.

  Capabilities are similar to Java interfaces, and provide a standard
way for the MediaDeviceHandler class to ask the many subclasses of
MediaDeviceHandler for what they are capable of, and depending on that,
will make different requests.  For instance, AudioCDs cannot
be written to, so they would have no use for WriteCapability, and don't
have to implement it.

  The MediaDeviceHandler has abstracted the logic so common to several
device implementations.  The libraries libgpod and libmtp, for
instance, are based on a struct that is a linked list of metadata, in
particular tracks.  The common way to parse the devices with these
libraries is to walk down this linked list until all metadata has been
read into the appropriate MediaDeviceMeta classes.  This is exactly
what the Handler does, and the only differences are the names of the
linked list structs, and the functions called or member data read to
retrieve this data.  It is these basic function calls that are then
called in the subclasses of the Capability classes, with the
top-level logic already standardized and done in the main
MediaDeviceHandler class.

Note: To see the logic hereto referred, check the MediaDeviceHandler's
calls to the Capability classes, and the order of the function calls. 
This helps to understand how best to map the functions of the
Capability interface, to function calls or member-data access using the
appropriate library.

2.3.2 Capabilities

ReadCapabilityBase - Maps the necessary functions to read the structs
specific to the device, with the goal of parsing the entire device's
metadata.  Can also read the device's capacity, used and total.  This
is a good Capability to subclass to initially test that the parsing is
being done correctly, before reading more information.

ReadCapability - Maps further functions, and completes the reading of
the metadata from the device.

CustomReadCapability - Essentially, a hack.  This is used by the
UMSHandler to "cheat" and just copy all the metadata it needs from
another Meta::Track which is already created by File::Track.  Do not
use this unless the device requires a similar quick hack, so as to
avoid a lot of redundant calls.

WriteCapabilityBase - Receives generic commands related to writing to
the device: find where to copy a new track onto the device, copy the
track, delete the track.  In case this device is not struct-based as
described above, this is a good candidate for just subclassing this
Capability for writing.

WriteCapability - In case the device is struct-based, subclass this
Capability to provide a full mapping onto the functions required to set
the metadata on a newly created track struct, and the higher logic of
in what order to do this is handled by the main Handler class.

ArtworkCapability - Optional.  If the device supports artwork, this
provides the interface for reading/writing that artwork.

PlaylistCapability - Optional.  If the device supports playlists, this
provides the interface for reading/writing playlists, parsing logic is
based again on a linked-list struct that is traversed in a standard
fashion.  The subclass of this just maps to the appropriate functions
to walk the linked list.


3. Appendix/Notes

- At the time of writing, there isn't a full implementation of Solid on
Windows or Mac, which limits support of devices mainly to Linux.  Also,
libraries used to interface at the low level (libgpod, libmtp) are
Linux-specific.
