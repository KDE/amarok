=== Const Correctness ===


What is const correctness?

It's a programming paradigm that helps writing correct code. In C++, const
correctness comprises a set of different techniques, you can read up about them
here [1]. In this article however I only want to focus on one form of const
correctness, that is object constness.

Why should I care about const correctness?

Because it increases type safety, makes your code more easy to understand, and
it helps making your code correct. Const objects can be seen as invariants in
mathematical terms, that is, objects that do not change, that do not vary. 

An example in code:



const int myNumber = 41;

int result;


result = myNumber + 1;

KMessageBox::information( 0, "The meaning of life is: " + QString::number(
result ) );



In this example, myNumber is a const object (an int is really a POD type, but
let that not distract us). This indicates that I cannot change the object. And
indeed, if I were to try that, the compiler would complain about it, which is a
good thing. It helps preventing mistakes by accidentally changing this object
later on.

Additionally, it helps readability, because anyone can clearly see that myNumber
is not meant to be changed. So you see, writing that "const" before it is a
little bit of work, but it has a big pay-off. I think it's worth it, so I try to
use it always in my code.
