This command is mandatory for all amarok developers:
git config branch.master.rebase true 

The result of this is that all "git pull" commands will do a rebase rather then a merge.
Your local commits will be rewritten (parented to origin/master). The prevents the log
to become unreadable because of all the merge commits.
