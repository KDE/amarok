Amarok - the audio player for KDE
===================================

There are many media players around these days, it's true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the playlist?
Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop interface
that really makes playlist handling easy.
