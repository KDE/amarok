      the collection setup dialog to rescan just that folder. This will only

    * Enhanced the playlist sorting breadcrumb items to separately highlight
      the order inversion arrow on hover. (BR 209011)

      playlist. (BR 216175)
    * Fixed crash if user clicks rating widget on the current track applet
      while no track is playing (which is possible since there is a slight
      delay before the applet switches "mode"). (BR 215471)

      tracks) correctly show up in the Current Track applet.

      permissions were fixed and their mtime updated, requiring a full rescan.
    * When using a MySQL server with "Watch Folders For Changes" disabled,
      very long periods of idle Amarok could allow the server to close the
      local connection. This is now detected and should be worked around. 
    * Correctly set the lyrics applet's title when displaying HTML formatted lyrics
    * Track selection is now correctly preserved when using Dynamic Playlists.
      Patch by John Atkinson <john@fauxnetic.co.uk>. (BR 208349)
    * Cover Manager no longer stops when one cover cannot be fetched. Patch by
      Tycho Andersen <kdebugs@tycho.ws>. (BR 205032)
    * Magnatune.com store: Fixed problematic use of external unzip command
      for unpacking downloaded album zip files. (BR 138499)

    * Amarok defaults to using the standard music storage location of the
      desktop environment.
    * LastFM: Now using the new and improved 1.2 protocol.
    * New Service Framework: Common framework for integrated services. A new
      framework for adding the content of online services directly into Amarok
      in a consistent and well integrated way. All services are plugins and can
      be enabled or disabled form the new service config screen. Services that
      are not loaded will not degrade performance or increase memory usage.
      The service frameworks also offers for free, or makes it very simple to
      add features such as cached albumcover downloads, searching and filtering
      to the individual services. Services can also be track providers, meaning
      that if amarok recieves a url that one of the services knows how to
      handle, they will be presented with all the metadata that the servie can
      provide.
    * Magnatune.com store: Support for purchases using Magnatune gift cards
    * Magnatune.com store: Support for the upcoming Magnatune.com stream and
      download memberships, allowing uninterrupred streaming at higher quality

      allowing the selection of mp3, ogg or lo-fi mp3 streams, and make ogg the
      default

      streaming and (using the default bit torrent client) downloads.

      Mp3Tunes.com locker has been added.
    * Ampache service: A new ampache plugin has been built on top of the service
      framework. Together with a recent version of Ampache, this allows the
      seamless integration of content from one or more Ampache servers directly
      into Amarok
    * OPML Directory service: A simple podcast directory service has been added
    * Shoutcast service: The shoutcast list from previous versions of Amarok has
      been reimplemented as a service.
    * Scriptable Service Manager: Add support for writing simple services using
      scripts. This allows quick prototyping of services as well as the
      integration and distribution of community created services. The scripted
      service can be started and stopped from the service manager. Also add 2
      simple demo scripts.
    * Playlist Framework: The Playlist Browser can now contain
      Playlists/Podcasts/Streams from any mediadevice/service/collection in
      addition to local files. Playlists are accessible by any Amarok subsystem
      and scripts.

    * Double clicking in the filebrowser will append to playlist. (BR 117465)

    * When generic media devices were specified manually, transferred files
      would not always get converted to VFAT-friendly names if they were on a
      VFAT filesystem.
    * When using ATF, tags in MP3 files would be written as ID3v2 only and
      existing ID3v1 tags would be stripped, which could lead to media devices
      and tagging libraries that were not ID3v2.4-aware to report that no tag
      existed.  Now both tags are written with identical data.

    * Automatically imported playlists go into a separate category.
    * Block quitting amaroK until all on-going media device operations have
      finished with a consistent state.
    * Interface choice in wizard removed.

    * Hint at starting a transcode script for transcoding while transferring
      to media devices. (BR 127155)
    * If a disc number is present, append it to the album's name when
      organizing files. (BR 126867)

      in context browser home view. Patch by Patrick Muench <s7mon@web.de>.
      (BR 127043)
    * Dynamic mode no longer skips to the next song if you press play (via
      dcop, for instance) while already playing a track. Instead it restarts
      the current one.
    * The Actions menu has been renamed the Engage menu. It's way cooler,

  ADD: viswidgetv2.  it seems a lot smoother on my machine.
       its quite easy to tweak the dynamics is needed.  is accessible the same as the other
       widgets, just click until it appears (though it looks the same as the original widget
       it just acts differently) - piggz (www.piggz.co.uk)
  ADD: combo with history and completion for dir/file chooser
  ADD: in configure.in.in for checking the version of TagLib, if compiled from CVS, if not,
       then show, that it uses bundled version of TagLib - Stormy
  FIX: font dialog sizing issues
  ADD: resume playback option. Using this means your track starts up again where you left it
       last time you quit amaroK. Excellent feature for us developers :-)

  added restarting of artsd on first program start to make sure it registers
    the new mcopclasses
  fixed possible compile error in viswidget.cpp
  amaroK uses much less CPU now than it used to. This was mainly achieved by
    using a new FFT-analyzer module, which I took from Noatuns "Winskin"-plugin,
    and modified slightly to my needs. Also some other optimizations were made,
    which improved the standby performance, when no song is playing. I'm still
    not satisfied with overall performance, tho, but it seems that most of the
    load is produced by the aRts code itself, so this will rather be difficult
    to improve.
  fixed crash when "next" or "previous" was pressed without a track
    loaded
  thanks to valgrind I was able to find and squish some serious bugs,
    most of which were related to pointers. to sum it up: pointers are evil.
    valgrind is great.
  lots of UI-changes in the main widget. uses a background pixmap now, a
    custom font and widget for the time-display, and generally looks better
  fixed issues with the liquid skin. unfortunately, there seems to be no way
    to display pushbuttons correctly with a black background under liquid. so,
    until I find a solution for that, the expandbutton widget doesn't look quite
    as cool as it used to. maybe I should ask mosfet about this..

VERSION 0.50:
  renamed 0.15 to 0.50

VERSION 0.15:
  playing streams now works! *yipeeee*
  fixed tons of bugs in aRts playing code. i think i got it right now.
  fixed loading and saving of playlists. can cope with all protocols now.

  Converting QString into std::string was not done correctly. Thanks to
    Whitehawk Stormchaser for that one :)

  implemented use of arts-software-mixing, in case hardware-mixing
  (/dev/mixer) doesn't work

  changed the direction of the volume-slider. maximum is now at the top
  added automatic saving of current playlist on exit
  added previous/next track
  added two radiobuttons in the playerwidget for toggling the
    playlist/equalizer on and off. admitted, the equalizer doesn't yet exist, so
    it's just a dummy button :P
  added popup-menu for the playerwidget. opens on
    right mouse button. this menu finally replaces the ugly menubar.
  added some icons (from noatun) for the player-buttons instead of text
  added pause function
  changed most names in the source to comply with the
    (unofficial?) KDE c++ coding standard (using the prefix "m_" for member
    attributes and so on). This was real slave-work :/
  cleaned up code in several classes
  fixed problem where subwidgets got keyboard focus and were drawn dark with
    the liquid style. switched off focus completely, since it's not needed for
    this type of application
