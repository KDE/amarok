amaroK packages for Debian
==========================

  A couple of notes which you may find useful:

    - if you want amarok to be able to play CDs, you need to install the
      kdemultimedia-kio-plugins package.

    - these Debian packages ship the amarokapp and amarok_xmmswrapper2
      binaries in /usr/lib/amarok instead of /usr/bin, which upstream
      does. This is done to comply with Debian Policy, which mandates
      that binaries not meant to be invoked by the user shall not reside
      in /usr/bin.

      You should experience no problems because of this change. If you
      do, please let me now.

  Also, users not using the full KDE environment may get the following
  error when executing amarok for the first time: "Socket-path is not a
  link or a directory: /home/$USER/.kde/socket-$HOSTNAME". Just execute:

    $ lnusertemp socket

  Note that you only need to execute it once, not each time that you
  start amaroK.
